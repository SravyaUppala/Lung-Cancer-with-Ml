Predictive Modelling of Lung Cancer Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Numerous genetic abnormalities and epigenetic modifications can accumulate to cause lung cancer, a disease that disturbs normal cell growth by causing unchecked cell proliferation. One of the most common malignancies to be diagnosed is lung cancer, which also accounts for most cancer-related deaths globally.
With 13% of all new cancer cases each year, it is the second most prevalent cancer diagnosis. Each year, 2.20 million new people are diagnosed with lung cancer, and 75% of them pass away within five years of receiving the diagnosis.Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that employs mathematical algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions. Large-scale medical data, such as imaging scans, genetic markers, patient histories, and treatment outcomes, might potentially be analysed using machine learning techniques to find patterns and insights that human clinicians might not be able to see right away. Healthcare professionals can improve the precision and efficacy of lung cancer diagnosis by utilising these techniques. In response to the urgent need for better predictive tools in lung cancer research, this work explores the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to accurately categorise lung cancer and uncover important risk factors linked to its progression.
